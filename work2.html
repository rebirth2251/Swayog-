            <div class="about1">
                <ul>
            <li> Blood pressure is a measure of the force exerted by blood against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps it around the body. It's like water pressure in a hose - the stronger the pump (heart) and the narrower the hose (arteries), the higher the pressure and It's like water pressure in a hose - the stronger the pump (heart) and the narrower the hose (arteries), measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) with a sphygmomanometer.</li>
             <li> Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers:</li> 
            </ul> 
             <ul> 
              <li> Systolic pressure: This is the higher number and represents the pressure when your heart contracts and pushes blood out to your body. </li>
              <li> Diastolic pressure: This is the lower number and represents the pressure when your heart relaxes between beats. </li>
            </ul>
