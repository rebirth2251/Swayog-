                        Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how the body converts food into energy. It occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose.
                        In simpler Words,
                        <ul style="list-style: disc;"> 
                    <li style="padding: 5px;"> Sugar as fuel: Imagine your body is a car, and sugar is the fuel. Your body uses sugar for energy to keep everything running smoothly.</li>
                    <li style="padding: 5px;"> Insulin: the key: This hormone, made by your pancreas, acts like a key that unlocks the doors to your cells, allowing sugar to enter and be used for energy. </li>
                    <li style="padding: 5px;"> The problem: In diabetes, there's an issue with this system. </li>
                </ul>
                </li>

                <li style="list-style: none; padding: 5px;"> There are two main types of diabetes:
                <ul style="list-style: disc;"> 
                <li style="padding: 5px;"> Type 1 Diabetes: This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. As a result, the body is unable to produce insulin, leading to an accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream. Type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed in children and young adults and requires lifelong insulin therapy. </li>    
                <li style="padding: 5px;"> Type 2 Diabetes: This is more common and usually develops later in life, although it can occur at any age. In type 2 diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use it effectively, a condition known as insulin resistance. This leads to elevated blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and obesity. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <!-- Causes -->
            <div class="causes5">
                <h2> causes </h2>
                <ol>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;"> The causes of diabetes differ between the two main types: Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. </li></ol>
                <ol>
                <li> Type 1 Diabetes:
                <ul>
                   <li> Autoimmune Response: The exact cause of Type 1 diabetes is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve an autoimmune response. The immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Genetic factors may play a role in predisposing individuals to this autoimmune response, and environmental triggers could potentially contribute. </li>
                   <li> Viral Infections: Some viral infections have been suggested as possible triggers for the autoimmune response leading to Type 1 diabetes. However, more research is needed to establish a clear link. </li>                                
                </ul></li>

                <li> Type 2 Diabetes:
                <ul>
                <li> Insulin Resistance: The primary cause of Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. This leads to an increased demand for insulin production. </li>
                <li> Genetic Factors: Family history and genetics can contribute to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. If your parents or siblings have the condition, your risk may be higher. </li>
                <li>
                    Lifestyle Factors: Unhealthy lifestyle choices significantly increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes. These factors include:
                    <ol>
                    <li> Poor Diet: Diets high in refined carbohydrates, sugars, and unhealthy fats can contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance. </li>
                    <li> Lack of Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyles and lack of regular exercise are associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> Obesity: Excess body weight, particularly around the abdomen, is a significant risk factor for Type 2 diabetes. Fat cells, especially in the abdominal area, can release substances that contribute to insulin resistance </li>
                <li> Age: The risk of Type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after the age of 45. </li>
                <li> Ethnicity: Some ethnic groups, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians, have a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. </li>
               </ul></li>
               </ol>
               <dl>
                <dt> Note :</dt>
                <dd> It's important to note that gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy, is another form of the condition. Hormonal changes and the body's increased demand for insulin during pregnancy can contribute to gestational diabetes. </dd>

            <!-- Symptoms -->
            <div class="symp5"> 
                <h2> Symptoms </h2>
                <ul>
                <li> Increased thirst (polydipsia): When your blood sugar is high, your body tries to flush out the excess through urine, making you feel thirstier to replenish fluids. </li>
                <li> Frequent urination (polyuria): This is a consequence of your body trying to get rid of excess sugar in the blood. </li>
                <li> Excessive hunger (polyphagia): Your cells aren't getting enough sugar for energy, so your body signals hunger even after eating. </li>
                <li> Unexplained weight loss: Although some might see weight loss as positive, in diabetes, it can happen because your body starts breaking down muscle for energy when it can't access sugar properly. </li>
                <li> Fatigue and tiredness: This lack of energy reaching your cells due to high blood sugar can leave you feeling constantly tired. </li>
                <li> Blurred vision: High blood sugar can damage the blood vessels in your eyes, leading to blurred vision. </li>
                <li> Slow-healing sores: Poor circulation caused by diabetes can make it harder for wounds to heal properly. </li>
                <li> Frequent infections: High blood sugar can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to infections like skin infections or yeast infections. </li>
                <li> Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet: Nerve damage caused by diabetes can lead to numbness, tingling, or pain, especially in the extremities. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Prevention-->
            <div class="pre5">
                <h2> Prevention </h2>
                <ul>
                <li> Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. But the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: 
                    <ol>
                    <li> Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Eat a variety to keep from feeling bored. </li>
                    <li> Get more physical activity. Try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. Or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. For example, take a brisk daily walk. If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day. </li><br>
                    <li> Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms), losing 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) can lower the risk of diabetes.</li>
                    </ol></li>
                <li> But don't try to lose weight during pregnancy. Talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. </li>
                <li> To keep your weight in a healthy range, work on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits. Remember the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and higher self-esteem. </li>
                </ul>

                    It's essential for individuals with diabetes to monitor their carbohydrate intake, choose whole and minimally processed foods, and pay attention to portion sizes. Working with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional can help create a personalized meal plan that meets individual dietary needs and helps manage blood sugar levels effectively.
