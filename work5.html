    <!-- About -->
    <div class="about1">
      <ul>
        <li> Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain, leading to a
          decline in cognitive function, memory loss, and eventually, the inability to carry out daily activities. It is
          the most common cause of dementia, accounting for the majority of dementia cases worldwide.</li>
        <li> Alzheimer's disease is typically divided into three stages: early (mild), middle (moderate), and late
          (severe) stages. Each stage is characterized by progressively worsening symptoms and increasing impairment in
          cognitive function, memory, and daily functioning. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Causes -->
    <div class="causes1">
      <h2> Causes </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Age: Age is the single greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, with the risk increasing significantly
          with advancing age. While Alzheimer's disease can affect individuals of any age, it is most commonly diagnosed
          in older adults, particularly those over the age of 65. </li>
        <li> Vascular Factors: Vascular factors such as hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, high cholesterol,
          obesity, and cardiovascular disease are associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
          These factors can contribute to vascular changes in the brain, such as reduced blood flow and small vessel
          disease, which may impair cognitive function and increase the risk of dementia. </li>
        <li> Abnormal Protein Accumulation: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal
          proteins in the brain, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Beta-amyloid plaques are clusters of
          beta-amyloid protein fragments that accumulate between nerve cells (neurons) and disrupt cell function, while
          tau tangles are twisted fibers of tau protein that accumulate inside neurons and interfere with cell
          communication. The exact role of these abnormal protein accumulations in the development of Alzheimer's
          disease is not fully understood, but they are believed to contribute to nerve cell damage and loss. </li>
        <li> Neuroinflammation: Chronic inflammation in the brain, known as neuroinflammation, is thought to play a role
          in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammatory processes may contribute to the
          formation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, as well as promote nerve cell damage and death. </li>
        <li> Environmental and Lifestyle Factors: Certain environmental and lifestyle factors may influence the risk of
          developing Alzheimer's disease. These factors include:
          <ul>
            <li> Chronic stress </li>
            <li> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) </li>
            <li> Exposure to environmental toxins or pollutants </li>
            <li> Lack of physical activity </li>
            <li> Unhealthy diet </li>
            <li> Smoking </li>
            <li> Excessive alcohol consumption </li>
            <li> Poor sleep quality or sleep disorders </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Symptoms -->
    <div class="symp1">
      <h2> Symptoms </h2>
      <p> Symptoms: Alzheimer's disease typically progresses slowly over several years, with symptoms worsening over
        time. Common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include: </p>
      <ul class="pad1">
      
        <li> Memory loss, particularly recent or short-term memory.</li>
      
        <li> Difficulty performing familiar tasks or following instructions. </li>
      
        <li> Challenges with problem-solving, planning, and decision-making. </li>
      
        <li> Confusion, disorientation, and difficulty understanding time or place. </li>
      
        <li> Language difficulties, such as finding words or following conversations. </li>
      
        <li> Changes in mood or behavior, including irritability, agitation, or withdrawal. </li>
      
        <li>Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities.</li>
      
        <li>Difficulty with coordination and motor function in later stages. </li>
      </ul>

    </div>

    <!-- Prevention-->
    <div class="pre1">
      <h2> Prevention </h2>
      <ul>
        
        <li> Healthy Diet: Consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and
          healthy fats may help support brain health and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Some dietary patterns,
          such as the Mediterranean diet or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, have been
          associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. </li>
        
        <li> Stay Mentally Active: Engage in activities that challenge your brain, such as learning a new language,
          taking up a musical instrument, or pursuing educational opportunities. Stimulating mental activities may help
          build cognitive reserve and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. </li>
        
        <li> Cognitive Training: Engaging in structured cognitive training programs designed to improve memory,
          attention, and problem-solving skills may help maintain cognitive function and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's
          disease, particularly in older adults. </li>
        
        <li> Healthy Lifestyle Choices: Avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight
          may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and support overall brain health. </li>
        
        <li> Mental Stimulation: Keeping the brain active and engaged through mentally stimulating activities such as
          reading, puzzles, games, learning new skills, or engaging in hobbies may help maintain cognitive function and
          reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. </li>
        
        <li> Social Engagement: Maintaining social connections and staying socially active may help support cognitive
          health and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Regular social interaction, participation in community
          activities, and maintaining close relationships with family and friends are all beneficial. </li>
        
        <li> Managing Chronic Conditions: Effectively managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, high
          cholesterol, and obesity through lifestyle modifications, medication, and regular medical care may help reduce
          the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as these conditions are associated with an increased risk of cognitive
          decline. </li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Food -->
    <div class=" fud1 ">
      <h2> Food </h2>
      <p> While there is no specific diet that can cure or prevent Alzheimer's disease, certain dietary patterns and
        foods have been associated with brain health and may help support cognitive function. Here are some foods and
        dietary recommendations that may be beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease or those looking to
        support brain health: </p>
      <ul>
      
        <li> Fruits and Vegetables: Incorporate a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables into your diet, as they are
          rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals that may help protect brain cells from damage.
          Aim for a diverse range of fruits and vegetables, including leafy greens, berries, citrus fruits, cruciferous
          vegetables, and colorful peppers. </li>
      
        <li> Healthy Fats: Incorporate healthy fats into your diet from sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive
          oil. These fats provide essential nutrients and may help support brain function. </li>
      
        <li> Whole Grains: Choose whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, barley, and whole wheat bread and pasta
          over refined grains. Whole grains are rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which may help
          support brain health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. </li>
      
        <li> Legumes: Legumes such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas are rich in fiber, protein, vitamins, and
          minerals. They are also a good source of complex carbohydrates, which provide sustained energy for the brain.
        </li>
      
        <li> Nuts and Seeds: Nuts and seeds such as walnuts, almonds, pecans, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are rich in
          healthy fats, protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They also contain antioxidants and other nutrients that
          may help support brain health. </li>
      </ul>
