            <!-- About -->
            <div class="about1">
              <ul>
                <li> 
                  Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. These seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can result in temporary changes in behavior, consciousness, movements, sensations, or awareness.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
            </div>

            <!-- Causes -->
            <div class="causes2">
            <h2> Causes </h2>
            <ul>
            <li> Genetic Factors: Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in many cases of epilepsy. Certain genetic mutations or inherited conditions may increase the risk of developing epilepsy. Family history of epilepsy or related neurological disorders can also be a contributing factor. </li>
            <li> Brain Injury or Trauma: Head injuries, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or other forms of brain trauma can lead to epilepsy, particularly if there is damage to areas of the brain responsible for regulating electrical activity. This can occur due to accidents, falls, sports injuries, or physical assaults. </li>
            <li> Brain Tumors and Structural Abnormalities: Brain tumors, such as gliomas or meningiomas, can cause seizures and lead to the development of epilepsy. Structural abnormalities in the brain, such as malformations of cortical development (e.g., focal cortical dysplasia), vascular abnormalities (e.g., arteriovenous malformations), or scars from previous brain surgeries or infections, can also increase the risk of epilepsy. </li>
            <li> Stroke and Vascular Conditions: Stroke, which disrupts blood flow to the brain, is a common cause of epilepsy, particularly in older adults. Other vascular conditions that affect blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral venous thrombosis or arteriosclerosis, can also lead to epilepsy. </li>
            <li> Infections: Certain infections of the central nervous system, such as meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscesses, can cause inflammation and damage to the brain tissue, leading to seizures and epilepsy. Infections acquired during childhood, such as congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) or childhood viral infections like measles or mumps, may also be associated with epilepsy. </li>
            <li> Developmental Disorders: Some developmental disorders that affect brain development, such as cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, or neurofibromatosis, can increase the risk of epilepsy. </li>
            <li> Metabolic and Neurodegenerative Disorders: Metabolic disorders that affect the body's ability to metabolize nutrients or maintain chemical balance, such as mitochondrial disorders or disorders of amino acid metabolism, may cause epilepsy. Additionally, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease can be associated with epilepsy as they progress. </li>
            <li> Perinatal Factors: Certain factors during pregnancy, childbirth, or early infancy may increase the risk of epilepsy later in life. These may include prenatal exposure to toxins, maternal infections during pregnancy, birth trauma, or complications during delivery. </li>
            <li> Autoimmune and Inflammatory Conditions: Autoimmune conditions affecting the central nervous system, such as autoimmune encephalitis or multiple sclerosis, can cause inflammation and damage to brain tissue, leading to seizures and epilepsy. </li>
            <li> Unknown Causes (Idiopathic Epilepsy): In many cases, the specific cause of epilepsy may not be identified despite thorough medical evaluation. This is often referred to as idiopathic epilepsy and may be attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. </li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Symptoms -->
            <div class="symp2">
                <h2> Symptoms </h2>
            <ul>
            <li> Aura: Some people with epilepsy experience a warning sign or sensation known as an aura before a seizure occurs. Auras can vary widely and may include feelings of déjà vu, fear, anxiety, or a sense of impending doom, as well as visual disturbances or strange smells. </li>
            <li> Postictal Period: Following a seizure, the person may experience a period of confusion, fatigue, headache, or muscle soreness known as the postictal period. This can last from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the severity of the seizure. </li>
            <li> Behavioral and Emotional Changes: Epilepsy can also be associated with behavioral and emotional changes, particularly in children. These may include mood swings, irritability, aggression, or changes in social behavior. </li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Prevention-->
            <div class="pre2">
            <h2> Precautions </h2>
            <ul>
            <li style="list-style: none;">While epilepsy cannot always be prevented, there are measures that individuals with epilepsy and their caregivers can take to reduce the risk of seizures and improve overall quality of life.  </li>
            <li style="list-style: none;">Here are some preventive strategies for epilepsy: </li>
          </ul>
            <ol>
            <li style="padding-bottom:10px;"> Medication Adherence: If prescribed antiepileptic medications, it's crucial to take them exactly as directed by a healthcare professional. Skipping doses or abruptly discontinuing medication can increase the risk of seizures. </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom:10px;"> Medical Alert Identification: Wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace with information about epilepsy and emergency contact details can be helpful in case of emergencies, particularly if seizures occur in public or unfamiliar settings. </li>
            
            <li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"> Identifying and avoiding triggers that may provoke seizures can help minimize their occurrence. Common triggers include:</li>
                <ul>
                 <li> Lack of sleep or irregular sleep patterns. </li>
                 <li> Stress and anxiety. </li>
                 <li> Certain medications or recreational drugs. </li>
                 <li> Alcohol consumption. </li>
                 <li> Specific foods or food additives. </li>
                 <li> Flashing lights or visual stimuli in photosensitive epilepsy. </li>
                </ul>    
                

                <li style="padding-bottom:10px;">Safety Precautions: Taking precautions to ensure safety during seizures can help prevent injuries and complications. This may include:</li>
                 <ul>
                 <li> Avoiding activities that pose a risk of injury during a seizure, such as swimming alone or working at heights. </li>
                 <li> Using protective gear or padding, such as helmets or knee pads, if at risk of falls. </li>
                 <li> Informing family members, friends, coworkers, and caregivers about how to respond to seizures and provide appropriate support. </li>
                 </ul>
               
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"> Avoid Triggers: Identifying and avoiding triggers that may provoke seizures can help minimize their occurrence. Common triggers include:</li>
                        <ul>
                         <li> Lack of sleep or irregular sleep patterns. </li>
                         <li> Stress and anxiety. </li>
                         <li> Certain medications or recreational drugs. </li>
                         <li> Alcohol consumption. </li>
                         <li> Specific foods or food additives. </li>
